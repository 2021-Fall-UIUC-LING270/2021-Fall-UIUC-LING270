## Course Overview

This course deals with the interrelated nature of language, technology, and society. We discuss the invention of writing as a language technology and how that gave rise to a series of cultural revolutions. We tackle the nature of society and what it means to be a social group, a social world. We will then move on to discuss language technologies such as the telegraph and discuss their impact on history. Finally, we will utilize the internet as a means by which we can re-evaluate our language and its impact on society on a global scale.
