<h2 id="project-proposal-2-of-course-grade">Project Proposal (2% of course grade)</h2>

<p>The purpose of this component of the assignment is to get you started on your project. 
For the proposal, you will write a short paper (~1 page single spaced) discussing your topic of interest. 
While grading your papers, I will advise you as to how you should continue with your topic; i.e. whether you should broaden or narrow the scope of the project.
In your paper, cite two of the sources you plan to use for the final paper, and briefly discuss what these sources say about your topic.
The proposal portion of the project will be due Tuesday, September 27th at 11:59 PM by email.</p>

<h2 id="project-report-18-of-course-grade">Project Report (18% of course grade)</h2>

<p>The purpose of your report is to give a more in-depth description of your topic in a paper format. 
Your paper should elaborate on the information given in your proposal and presentation. 
I will give you more detailed feedback from the project proposal what kinds of things I will look for from each of your for your submission, 
as the format of your paper will likely vary depending on the topic you choose to research.
Your paper should be 5-6 pages in length, single spaced, 12 point font.
You should include a bibliography of the sources you use in the paper.
I will not require any format for the bibliography (such as MLA or APA), 
so long as I can easily identify the sources that you used, and access them myself if need be.</p>

<p>The final paper will be due on Monday, December 13th at 11:59 PM by email.</p>
